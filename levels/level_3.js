    missionBrief: `Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield. The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by. You are clear to proceed. 

    Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. 
    
    The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. 
    
    I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will.`
